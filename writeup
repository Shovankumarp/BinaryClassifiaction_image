The repository is for classifying Binary Class Images using Convolutional Neural Network. It has the following steps.

    1. Environment Setup
    2. Dataset Downloading
    3. Image Preproessing
    4. Model Building
    5. Training
    6. Evaluation
    7. Prediction using the trained model

1. Environment Setup
